Thank you for using MericSounds! My collection of various audio samples that I've picked up over time.
This soundpack is primarily focused for people who wished to make orchestral type music in NBS, however you will find
some non-orchestral sound samples as well.

Sounds are divided into sections (I.E. Woodwinds) which are then divided into instruments (I.E. flute) 
which are then divided into fonts (I.E. Japanese Flute, or Pan Flute I, and Pan Flute II)
Each font will contain articulations which can be used to add further detail into your piece. (I.E. Marcato, Sustain, Staccato)
Note that not every font has every articulation. If you are unsure which to use, or wish to conserve the amount of CI you are using,
the sustain articulation is meant to be the "fit all" standard articulation. A sample that is marked "sustained" does not mean it cannot
be used in a staccato format. For example the airy_flute_sustained sample sounds excellent both in short or long note form.
Your best way to know what works best is to simply test these samples in your songs!

Most sound samples are tuned to F#4 (Standard) however some may be tuned an octave higher or lower.
